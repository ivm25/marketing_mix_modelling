# marketing_mix_modelling

--

1. *Business Problem*:
    - Non existence of easily explainable, presentable and robust
      marketing mix models.
    - The existing models are either very complex and a black box to the
      key stakeholders or they are not robust enough to explain all
      possible economic and non-econmic factors responsbile for the
      success/non-success of marketing projects.

2. *Aims of the project*:
      a) Develop a marketing mix modelling prototype project that can be
         scaled for different scenarios.
      b) Present the key findings in a simple and engaging manner to non-
         technical people.
      c) Take into account adstock scenarios and aim to develop modular 
         structure, keeping in mind future scaling.

3. *Key Deliverables*:
      a) A modular script structure in python that creates a basic 
         marketing mix model.
      b) Use dash to create a simple way to interact with the charts and 
         key model outputs.
